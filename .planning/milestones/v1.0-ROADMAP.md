# Milestone v1.0: UI/UX Improvements

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-08
**Phases:** 1-3
**Total Plans:** 17 plans (10 Phase 1 + 3 Phase 2 + 4 Phase 3)

## Overview

This roadmap delivers a comprehensive UI/UX overhaul of the hyperscale game, focusing on:
1. **Layout consistency** across all 8 game stages
2. **Tinder-style swipe animations** with spring physics
3. **Visual polish** and performance optimization

---

## Phase 1: Layout Foundation

**Goal:** Establish consistent, responsive layout system that eliminates visual jumps

**Duration:** 1-2 days
**Requirements:** 5 (LAYOUT-01 through LAYOUT-05)
**Completed:** 2026-02-07

### Success Criteria

1. Navigate through all 8 stages on desktop — no visual jumps, content stays centered
2. Navigate through all 8 stages on mobile — no visual jumps, content starts from consistent top position
3. Resize browser window on desktop — centered content doesn't shift when scrollbar appears/disappears
4. Scroll on mobile browser — content stays stable when toolbars collapse/expand
5. Code review: LayoutShell component used consistently across all stages

### Plans

**Plans:** 10 plans in 5 waves (includes 5 gap closure plans)

**Foundation Plans:**
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Create LayoutShell component with responsive logic
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Update Intro, Personality Select, Role Select screens
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — Update Initializing, Boss Fight, Game Over, Summary screens
- [x] 01-04-PLAN.md — Refactor Game screen and add scrollbar/viewport fixes
- [x] 01-05-PLAN.md — Human verification of all 8 stages

**Gap Closure Plans (from verification):**
- [x] 01-06-PLAN.md — Fix desktop centering for all 8 screens
- [x] 01-07-PLAN.md — Fix Game screen mobile layout issues
- [x] 01-08-PLAN.md — Fix scrollbar first render (remove overflow conflicts)
- [x] 01-09-PLAN.md — Fix roast window and boot button cutoff (taskbar clearance)
- [x] 01-10-PLAN.md — Fix answer overlay centering and HUD cutoff (positioning context)

### Implementation Notes

**Order of operations:**
1. Create LayoutShell component with responsive logic (Plan 01)
2. Update first 3 non-gameplay screens (Plan 02)
3. Update remaining 4 non-gameplay screens (Plan 03)
4. Refactor Game screen + add scrollbar-gutter + replace 100vh (Plan 04)
5. Human verification across all breakpoints (Plan 05)

**Key files to modify:**
- `App.tsx` - Refactor all render methods
- `index.html` - Add scrollbar-gutter CSS
- `components/LayoutShell.tsx`

## Phase 2: Swipe Interactions

**Goal:** Implement Tinder-style swipe animations with spring physics and card stack

**Duration:** 2-3 days
**Requirements:** 4 (SWIPE-01, SWIPE-03, SWIPE-04, SWIPE-05)
**Note:** SWIPE-02 (card lift) was removed per user decision

### Success Criteria

1. Drag card partially — spring physics returns it smoothly when released
2. Drag past threshold — card exits with rotation animation
3. Next card visible underneath — creates "deck" feel
4. Gradient preview appears when swiping — scales with distance
5. 60fps performance on mid-range mobile device

### Plans

**Plans:** 3 plans in 2 waves

- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — CSS Animation System (spring physics + exit animations)
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Card Stack & Enhanced Preview (SWIPE-03 + SWIPE-04)
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — Human verification of all swipe interactions

### Implementation Notes

**Order of operations:**
1. **Wave 1 (Parallel):**
   - Plan 01: Add spring physics CSS and refine exit animations in index.html
   - Plan 02: Implement card stack and enhanced preview in App.tsx
2. **Wave 2:**
   - Plan 03: Human verification across devices

**Wave Structure:**
```
Wave 1:
├── 02-01: CSS animations (independent)
└── 02-02: Card stack (independent of 02-01)

Wave 2:
└── 02-03: Human verification (depends on 02-01, 02-02)
```

**Key files to modify:**
- `App.tsx` - Game screen renderGame() method
- CSS animations in `index.html` style block

---

## Phase 3: Polish & Performance

**Goal:** Consistent transitions, design audit, and performance optimization

**Duration:** 1-2 days
**Requirements:** 3 (TRANS-01, DESIGN-01, PERF-01)
**Completed:** 2026-02-08

### Plans

**Plans:** 4 plans in 2 waves (includes 1 gap closure plan)

**Foundation Plans:**
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Standardize stage transition animations (TRANS-01)
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Design audit and visual system standardization (DESIGN-01)
- [x] 03-03-PLAN.md — Performance optimization and Lighthouse audit (PERF-01)

**Gap Closure Plans (from verification):**
- [x] 03-04-PLAN.md — Lighthouse performance audit gap closure

### Wave Structure

```
Wave 1 (Parallel):
├── 03-01: Transition animations (independent)
└── 03-02: Design audit (independent of 03-01)

Wave 2:
└── 03-03: Performance optimization (depends on 03-01, 03-02)
```

### Success Criteria

1. All stage transitions feel consistent — same animation, duration, easing
2. Visual audit complete — typography, colors, spacing consistent across all screens
3. Touch gestures run at 60fps — no dropped frames on swipe
4. Lighthouse performance score ≥ 90

## Risk Factors & Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Card stack affects performance | Medium | High | Pre-render next card, use CSS transforms only |
| Spring physics feels wrong | Low | Medium | Use CSS first, iterate on cubic-bezier values |
| Layout changes break mobile | Low | High | Test on real devices, not just emulators |
| Keyboard navigation breaks | Medium | Medium | Maintain existing arrow key handlers |
| Timeline extends | Medium | Low | Phase 3 can be trimmed if needed |

---

## Dependencies

**Phase 1 → Phase 2:**
- LayoutShell must be stable before adding card stack
- Responsive breakpoints defined in Phase 1 used in Phase 2

**Phase 2 → Phase 3:**
- Swipe animations complete before performance optimization
- Card positions finalized before design audit

**No external dependencies:**
- All work is self-contained in existing codebase
- No new libraries needed

---

## Future Considerations (v2+)

Not in this roadmap but worth noting:
- Sound effects and haptics
- Stats update animations
- Reduced motion support
- PWA enhancements
- Additional card types/mechanics
