## Objective

Human verification of all swipe interactions implemented in Phase 2. Test spring physics, card stack visibility, gradient preview scaling, and exit animations across devices.

**Purpose:** Ensure the swipe interactions feel premium and work correctly on real devices before considering Phase 2 complete.

**Output:** Human-verified approval of all swipe interactions, or documented issues for fixing.

### Requirements Being Verified

**SWIPE-01: Spring physics snap-back animation**
- CSS cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1) for soft bouncy return
- Triggered when swipe released under threshold (100px)
- Duration: 500-600ms for natural feel

**SWIPE-03: Card stack showing next card underneath**
- Next card rendered behind current card with z-index: 0
- Scale: 0.95, Opacity: 0.6 for depth effect
- Same size and dimensions as current card

**SWIPE-04: Enhanced gradient/text swipe preview**
- Red/green gradient overlay scales with distance
- Text label scales from 0.5 to 1.0 with swipe distance
- Appears when swipe exceeds 50px (SWIPE_PREVIEW_THRESHOLD)

**SWIPE-05: Smooth card exit animations**
- Left exit: translateX(-120%) rotate(-25deg) + fade out
- Right exit: translateX(120%) rotate(25deg) + fade out
- Duration: 350ms with cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94)

## Tasks

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 1: Verify spring physics snap-back</name>
  <files>N/A (manual testing)</files>
  <action>
    Test the spring physics snap-back animation:

    **Test Steps:**
    1. Open the game at `http://localhost:5173` (or deployed URL)
    2. Navigate through Intro → Personality → Role → Game
    3. Start dragging a card but release BEFORE crossing the threshold (less than 100px)
    4. Observe the card spring back to center

    **What to Verify:**
    - [ ] Card springs back smoothly when released under threshold
    - [ ] Animation has a subtle "bounce" or overshoot (not linear)
    - [ ] Duration feels natural (not too fast, not too slow)
    - [ ] No jank or stuttering during the animation

    **Compare to:**
    - Bad: Linear return (no bounce)
    - Good: Soft bouncy return with slight overshoot

    **Expected feel:** Premium, satisfying, like a rubber band snapping back
  </action>
  <verify>
    Manual observation of animation quality
  </verify>
  <done>
    Spring physics feels smooth and natural with subtle overshoot
  </done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 2: Verify card stack visibility</name>
  <files>N/A (manual testing)</files>
  <action>
    Test the card stack showing next card underneath:

    **Test Steps:**
    1. Navigate to the game screen
    2. Look at the card area before swiping
    3. Start dragging the current card to the side
    4. Observe what's visible behind the current card

    **What to Verify:**
    - [ ] Next card is visible underneath the current card
    - [ ] Next card appears slightly smaller (scaled down ~95%)
    - [ ] Next card is dimmed (not full opacity)
    - [ ] Creates a "deck" or stack feel
    - [ ] Last card (no next card) doesn't show empty space awkwardly

    **On Mobile:**
    - Test on actual mobile device (iOS Safari or Android Chrome)
    - Verify visibility in portrait orientation

    **Compare to:**
    - Bad: No card visible behind, just background
    - Good: Clear next card visible, creating sense of progression
  </action>
  <verify>
    Visual confirmation of card stack depth effect
  </verify>
  <done>
    Next card is clearly visible underneath with appropriate scale/opacity
  </done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 3: Verify gradient and text preview scaling</name>
  <files>N/A (manual testing)</files>
  <action>
    Test the enhanced swipe preview with distance scaling:

    **Test Steps:**
    1. Navigate to the game screen
    2. Start swiping a card slowly to the RIGHT
    3. Continue dragging past 50px (threshold for preview)
    4. Keep dragging toward 100px (commit threshold)
    5. Observe the green preview text and gradient
    6. Release before 100px (snap back)
    7. Repeat swiping LEFT to test red preview

    **What to Verify:**
    - [ ] Preview appears after ~50px swipe
    - [ ] Text label (e.g., "DEBUG", "PASTE") starts small
    - [ ] Text grows larger as swipe progresses
    - [ ] Gradient overlay gets more intense with distance
    - [ ] No generic icons (✓/✗) — only contextual labels
    - [ ] Labels are readable during swipe

    **Scale Check:**
    - At 50px: Text should be ~50% size
    - At 100px: Text should be ~100% size
    - Progression should feel smooth, not abrupt

    **Compare to:**
    - Bad: Static preview that doesn't change with distance
    - Good: Dynamic preview that builds as user commits to swipe
  </action>
  <verify>
    Visual confirmation of scaling behavior
  </verify>
  <done>
    Preview scales smoothly from 0.5 to 1.0 as swipe progresses
  </done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 4: Verify exit animations</name>
  <files>N/A (manual testing)</files>
  <action>
    Test the card exit animations when crossing threshold:

    **Test Steps:**
    1. Navigate to the game screen
    2. Swipe a card past the threshold (>100px) to the RIGHT
    3. Observe the exit animation
    4. After feedback overlay, next card appears
    5. Swipe next card past threshold to the LEFT
    6. Observe the exit animation

    **What to Verify:**
    - [ ] Card rotates as it exits (left = rotate negative, right = rotate positive)
    - [ ] Card moves significantly off-screen (120% translate)
    - [ ] Card fades out during exit
    - [ ] Animation feels "thrown" not just "slid"
    - [ ] Duration feels right (~350ms, not too fast or slow)
    - [ ] Next card slides up smoothly after exit

    **Compare to:**
    - Bad: Card just slides sideways with no rotation
    - Good: Card rotates and flies off screen satisfyingly

    **Technical Check:**
    - Left exit should rotate counter-clockwise (negative degrees)
    - Right exit should rotate clockwise (positive degrees)
  </action>
  <verify>
    Visual confirmation of exit animation quality
  </verify>
  <done>
    Exit animations feel satisfying with proper rotation and translate
  </done>

    - [ ] Cards animate properly with keyboard
    - [ ] No console errors
    - [ ] Both desktop and laptop keyboards work

  <name>Task 6: Performance check on mobile</name>
  <files>N/A (manual testing)</files>

    Verify performance target of 60fps on mobile:

    **Test Steps:**
    1. Open game on a mid-range mobile device (or use DevTools performance throttling)
    2. Swipe cards repeatedly
    3. Observe for any jank, stuttering, or dropped frames
    4. Test during all animations (drag, snap-back, exit)

    **What to Verify:**

    - [ ] No visible stuttering during spring snap-back
    - [ ] Exit animation is smooth
    - [ ] Card stack doesn't cause performance issues
    - [ ] Preview scaling doesn't cause lag
